# Installation

1. This project requires the modified CoACD package, that can be found here: <https://github.com/EgorFokin/CoACD>. Note that mentioned repository has submodules, that need to be installed.
2. You also have to install pointnet2_ops library from https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch. This library works only with Cuda 11.8. To use newer Cuda versions, you could try downloading this pull request: https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch/pull/186
3. To install other python packages use:
   > pip install requirements.txt

# Usage

## Training

1. Put ShapeNet dataset in data/ShapeNetCore
2. Preprocess dataset using generate_targets.py, obj_to_cloud.py and redistribute_shapenet.py. You can also use already generated targets in plane_cache.json
3. Run train.py. Change the constants inside the script to configure training.

## Inference

To decompose a mesh use:

> python decompose.py _filename_ _depth_(optional)

For evaluation place v-hacd dataset in data/v_hacd and use evaluate_coacd.py or evaluate_neuralacd.py. Change RANDOM_ROTATION to True to use random rotation.
